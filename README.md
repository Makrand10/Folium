# Book Reader ‚Äì Next.js + MongoDB (GridFS)

A minimal web app to read EPUB books in the browser. Search the library, explore books (built-ins + user uploads), upload your own `.epub`, and continue reading right where you left off.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Home:** search bar, **Continue** card (last-read), Upload entry, and a row of library cards.
- **Explore:** grid of all books (existing + user uploads).
- **Search:** server-side text search on title/author/tags.
- **Reader:** opens `/read/[bookId]` and renders the same book in EPUB format.
- **Upload:** add an EPUB; files are stored in **MongoDB GridFS**; metadata saved in Mongo.
- **Progress save:** automatically stores EPUB CFI so the **Continue** card can resume.

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- **Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** with **GridFS** (store EPUBs)
- **epub.js / react-reader** (in-browser EPUB rendering)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
